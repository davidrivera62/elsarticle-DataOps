\begin{abstract}
The application of agile methodologies and the continuous practices of DevOps are used in analytical projects, seeking to present the results of the data models developed in a faster way, with greater control of the construction process and with higher quality. This has meant that both the agile development processes are adjusted to the needs of the analytical projects and the engineers and data scientists have adjusted their tools and infrastructure to these practices to receive the expected benefits. This review explores the availability with respect to previous works in the fields of Data Science supported by DevOps practices, how processes and development flows should be modeled under these practices, and finally, contrast these bases with visions both academic and industry about this methodology that has been called \textit{DataOps}\textit{}

\section{The Elsevier article class}

\paragraph{Installation} If the document class \emph{elsarticle} is not available on your computer, you can download and install the system package \emph{texlive-publishers} (Linux) or install the \LaTeX\ package \emph{elsarticle} using the package manager of your \TeX\ installation, which is typically \TeX\ Live or Mik\TeX.

\paragraph{Usage} Once the package is properly installed, you can use the document class \emph{elsarticle} to create a manuscript. Please make sure that your manuscript follows the guidelines in the Guide for Authors of the relevant journal. It is not necessary to typeset your manuscript in exactly the same way as an article, unless you are submitting to a camera-ready copy (CRC) journal.

\item front matter
\item keywords and MSC codes
\item theorems, definitions and proofs
\item lables of enumerations
\item citation style and labeling.
\end{itemize}

\section{Front matter}

The author names and affiliations could be formatted in two ways:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item Group the authors per affiliation.
\item Use footnotes to indicate the affiliations.
\end{enumerate}
See the front matter of this document for examples. You are recommended to conform your choice to the journal you are submitting to.
